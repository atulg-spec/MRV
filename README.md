# 🌿 Blue Carbon MRV System  
### A Prototype by Team **CarbonCoders.PSITCHE** for Smart India Hackathon 2025

---

## 🧩 Project Overview  

The **Blue Carbon MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification)** System is an innovative digital platform designed to streamline and digitize the management of blue carbon restoration projects. Developed by **Team CarbonCoders.PSITCHE**, this prototype demonstrates an end-to-end system that enables **NGOs, coastal communities, and environmental organizations** to register, monitor, and verify their coastal ecosystem restoration projects.

Our goal is to make **blue carbon restoration** — particularly **mangrove and seagrass ecosystems** — measurable, reportable, and verifiable through a transparent, scalable, and digital interface.

## ⚙️ Core Workflow  

Our system follows a clear five-step pipeline that simplifies and digitizes the traditional MRV process:

1. **Registration Phase**  
   NGOs and community-based organizations register themselves and their respective blue carbon projects.  

2. **Project Submission**  
   They upload project details including geotagged locations, baseline surveys, images, and documents.  

3. **Monitoring Module**  
   Regular updates on mangrove growth, soil carbon content, and ecosystem recovery are recorded and visualized.  

4. **Verification Process**  
   Designated verifiers and NCCR officials review submitted data, ensuring authenticity and quality.  

5. **Dashboard & Reporting**  
   Verified projects appear in the public dashboard with detailed progress, status indicators, and carbon sequestration data.  

> The current prototype simulates blockchain transparency and immutability by maintaining secure, traceable transaction logs.

## 🧭 NCCR Dashboard  

The **NCCR (National Centre for Coastal Research)** Dashboard serves as the administrative hub for project verification and impact tracking. It provides a top-down view of all registered projects, enabling NCCR and government authorities to oversee blue carbon restoration initiatives nationwide.

### ✨ Key Features:
- Overview of all registered and verified restoration projects.  
- Project status tracking by geography and type.  
- Data visualization of carbon sequestration metrics.  
- Exportable reports for climate policy and decision-making.

## 🌊 Impacts and Benefits  

The implementation of our MRV system creates tangible social, environmental, and economic impacts:

- **⏱️ Faster Verification:** Reduces manual verification time by **up to 60%** through automated workflows.  
- **🔒 Data Transparency:** Simulated blockchain ensures every update and verification step is traceable.  
- **👥 Community Empowerment:** Enables **2000+ coastal communities** to showcase verified restoration work.  
- **🌍 Policy Support:** Provides real-time data to support **India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** under the Paris Agreement.  
- **💰 Carbon Credit Market Integration:** Creates a foundation for verified projects to attract **carbon investors** and generate sustainable revenue streams.

## 🧠 Technological Flow  

The platform is built with a scalable, modular architecture that can easily integrate real blockchain and AI modules in future releases.

### **Architecture Overview:**
- **Frontend:** HTML + Tailwind CSS (mobile-first design).  
- **Backend:** Django Framework (Python).  
- **Database:** SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production-ready).  
- **Authentication:** Secure NGO and verifier login system.  
- **Data Layer:** Simulated blockchain logs for data authenticity.  
- **API Layer:** RESTful APIs for inter-module communication.
